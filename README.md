## Technology Stack

| Layer         | Technology                   |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Frontend      | HTML, CSS, JavaScript        |

4. Weather data is sent back to the frontend and displayed dynamically.
5. User search data is saved to the MySQL database for history and analytics.
